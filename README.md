# Obara-Saika

Obara-Saika integral code sandbox.

This is a terribly slow but in principle open-ended recursive
implementation of the
[Obara-Saika algorithm](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.450106) using
Python.

It may be useful for educational purposes or to generate and/or test a
more efficient code.

The computed integrals are not normalized.
